# Day 66
In Day 66 we learn about Closures in JavaScript.

### JavaScript Closures
* JavaScript variables can belong to the ```local ```or ```global``` scope.

### What is a closure?
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: 
* access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets)
* access to the outer function’s variables
* access to the global variables.
