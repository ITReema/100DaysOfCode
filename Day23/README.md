# Day 23
In Day 23 we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### Labeled statements 
Label statement provides an identifier for a statement that lets you refer to it using a ```break``` or ```continue``` statement.

**Syntax:**
```
label :
   statements
```
```label```
Any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word.<br>
```statement```
A JavaScript statement. ```break``` can be used with any labeled statement, and ```continue``` can be used with looping labeled statements.

### The break statement
The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
